# Authentication flow

This chapter explains the high-level authentication flow from the perspective
of a user's client software that wants to access a protected resource that is
secured by an authentication server.  
As an example, we will look at the `loopd` client that wants to do a loop out
swap with the Lightning Lab's loop server.

**First time looping out**:
1. A loop user wishes to perform a swap with the loop server. They type the
  command `loop out <amount>` and hit return.
1. The `loopd` client program contacts the loop server to initiate the swap.
1. The call from the client must always go through the authentication server
  reverse proxy, which in this example is `kirin`. The authentication proxy
  notices that the client didn't send an LSAT and therefore cannot be granted
  access to the loop server.
1. `kirin` instructs its own `lnd` instance to create an invoice over a small
  amount that is required to acquire a fresh token.
1. In addition to the invoice, `kirin` also creates a fresh access token that is
  tied to the invoice. The token is cryptographically constructed in a way that
  it is only valid once the invoice has been paid.
1. The token and the invoice are sent back to the client in the previously
  unused HTTP header `402 Payment Required`.
1. The `loopd` understands this returned error code, extracts the invoice from
  it and automatically instructs its connected `lnd` instance to pay the
  invoice.
1. Paying the invoice results in the `loopd` client now possessing the
  cryptographic proof of payment (the pre-image). This proof is stored in the
  client's local storage, together with the access token.
1. The combination of the access token and the pre-image yields a fully valid
  LSAT that can be cryptographically verified.
1. The client now repeats the original request to the loop server, now attaching
  the LSAT to the request.
1. The authentication server intercepts the request, extracts the LSAT and
  validates it. Because the LSAT is valid, the request is forwarded to the
  actual loop server that then initiates the swap.
1. The answer of the swap server is returned to the client and the swap is
  now initiated.
1. The whole process is fully transparent to the user. The only thing they might
  notice is a short delay of a few seconds on the first ever loop. Each
  successive loop will use the same token and will not be delayed at all.
